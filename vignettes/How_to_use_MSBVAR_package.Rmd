Furthermore, as recently emphasized by Cogley and Sargent
(2003), overlooking heteroskedasticity would generate fictitious dynamics in the random coefficients.
Consider the model
$$

y_t=c_t+B_{1,t Y{t-1}}+\ldots+B_{k,t y_{t-k}}+\mu_t
$$
where $y_t$ is an $n*1$ vector of observed endogenous vaiables;$c_t$ is an $n*1$ vector fo time varying coefficients.
$$
\tag{1.2}
y_t=c_t+\mathbb{B}_{1,t y_{t-1}}+\ldots+\mathbb{B}_{k,t y_{t_k}}

# Gibbs sampler for a Markov-switching Bayesian reduced form vector autoregression model
- Description
Draws a Bayesian posterior sample for a Markov-switching Bayesian reduced form vector autoregression model based on the setup from the msbvar function.

- Details
This function implements a Gibbs sampler for the posterior of a MSBVAR model setup with
msbvar. This is a reduced form MSBVAR model. The estimation is done in a mixture of native R code and Fortran. The sampling of the BVAR coefficients, the transition matrix, and the error
covariances for each regime are done in native R code. The forward-filtering-backward-sampling
of the Markov-switching process (The most computationally intensive part of the estimation) is
handled in compiled Fortran code. As such, this model is reasonably fast for small samples / small
numbers of regimes (say less than 5000 observations and 2-4 regimes). The reason for this mixed
implementation is that it is easier to setup variants of the model (E.g., Some coefficients switching,
others not; different sampling methods, etc. Details will come in future versions of the package.)
The random permuation of the states is done using a multinomial step: at each draw of the Gibbs
sampler, the states are permuted using a multinomial draw. This generates a posterior sample where
the states are unidentified. This makes sense, since the user may have little idea of how to select
among the h! posterior models of the reduced form MSBVAR model (see e.g., Fruhwirth-Schnatter
(2006)). Once a posterior sample has been draw with random permuation, a clustering algorithm
(see plotregimeid) can be used to identify the states, for example, by examining the intercepts or
covariances across the regimes (see the example below for details).
Only the Beta.idx or Sigma.idx value is followed. If the first is given the second will be ignored.
So variance ordering for identification can only be used when Beta.idx=NULL. See plotregimeid
for plotting and summary methods for the permuted sampler.
The Gibbs sampler is estimated using six steps:
Drawing the state-space for the Markov process This step uses compiled code to draw the 0-1
matrix of the regimes. It uses the Baum-Hamilton-Lee-Kim (BHLK) filter and smoother to
estimate the regime probabilities. Draws are based on the standard forward-filter-backwardsample algorithm.
Drawing the Markov transition matrix Q Conditional on the other parameters, this takes a draw
from a Dirichlet posterior with the alpha.prior prior.
Regression step update Conditional on the state-space and the Markov-switching process data
augmentation steps, estimate a set of h regressions, one for each regime.
Draw the error covariances, Σh Conditional on the other steps, compute and draw the error covariances from an inverse Wishart pdf.
Draw the regression coefficients For each set of classified observations’ (based on the previous
step) BVAR regression coefficients, take a draw from their multivariate normal posterior.
Permute the states If permute = TRUE, then permute the states and the respective coefficients.
The state-space for the MS process is a T × h matrix of zeros and ones. Since this matrix classifies
the observations infor states for the N2 posterior draws, it does not make sense to store it in double
precisions. We use the bit package to compress this matrix into a 2-bit integer representation
for more efficient storage. Functions are provided (see below) for summarizing and plotting the
resulting state-space of the MS process.
